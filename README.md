# tkinter-helloworld
Lil hello world for python graphics because why do I still not know how to use tkinter correctly??

### Setup (mostly reminders on using venv)

#####Create and activate a new virtual env:

`python3 -m venv tkinter-env`

`source tkinter-env/bin/activate`

(`deactivate` to get out)

On Macos installing this is slightly different, you can't install it via pip. So instead do:

`brew install python3-tk`

#####Install deps with requirements file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

(The installation for tkinter will fail if on macos but if you install it with the above instructions it'll be fine)

This will install: 

- tkinter
- some other stuff
